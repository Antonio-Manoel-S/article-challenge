## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.**

### The challenge
 The position:absolute/relative relaction, and positioning the elements.

## My process

### Built with
- Editor Spck [mobile]

### What I learned
 I don't understood well how the position relative works, its kinda like you reposition the element in inverse -like as you write 100% bottom, the element go up. That's contradictory, and mess my brain!- but, if worked, it works. Not good as the design source, but, similarly, i guess. The JavaScript part was much more easier to do. Just do .classList.toggle() a hidden class in the div.

## Acknowledgments

That alignment part was a nightmare. I like comprehend every code, but, the position relative thing don't enter on my head. And, as i was procrastinating for a month, i give up know deeply. I want to learn more JavaScript codes.
